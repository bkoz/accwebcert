      <h3>OpenGL Shading Framework</h3>

      <p>
        I developed an object oriented framework to make working with OpenGL 2.1 easier. The C++ class library initializes OpenGL
        extension entry points, provides file loading, compiling, linking and error checking of vertex and fragment programs.
        Run time methods are provided to enable, disable and pass parameters to programs. The framework’s base classes can
        be sub classed to create more complex shaders as shown in the example below.

      <h3>Win32 Port</h3>
      <img src="images/win32.jpg" alt="Win32 Port" width=512 height=256> 
      <p>I ported a suite of multi-threaded, client-server applications used in
      the visualization of radio frequency signals for the Espy Corporation from Linux to Microsoft Windows. The port, which
      included hundreds of C++ classes, 15 libraries and 6 applications, consisted of 3D rendering, audio playback, networking
      and system level programming.</p>

      <h3>Parallel Ray Tracer</h3>

      <img src="images/smpray.jpg" alt="Parallel Ray Tracer"> 
      <figcaption>SMP Ray Tracer</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I ported a real-time SMP ray tracing program from IRIX/GL/SPROC
      to Linux/OpenGL/POSIX threads to demonstrate how scalable computing can be synchronized with double buffered OpenGL
      rendering. Arrays of semaphores were used to provide a barrier to synchronize worker threads with OpenGL buffer swaps.

      <h3>GPU-based Scalable Volumetric Shading</h3>

      <img src="images/skullshaded.jpg" alt="Volumetric Shader"> 
      <figcaption>Phong Shading Model</figcaption>
    </figure>
      <p>For SGI’s Prism system, I implemented a GPU fragment program,
      written in SIMD assembler, that performs high quality lighting on volumetric data. The OpenGL Volumizer API provided
      a multiple GPU scalable framework based on 2D screen decomposition. As each slice of the volume is rendered, callbacks
      are used to generate texture coordinates which are passed to the fragment shader. Using the texture coordinates, the
      shader computes the gradients on the fly using a forward difference method. Once the gradients are obtained, a full
      Phong lighting model is computed for each fragment. The user is able to control the light source and object position
      in real time.</p>

      <h3>3D MRI Reconstruction</h3>
      <figure>

      <figcaption>Bob's brain</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> This sample application was written to complement an introductory seminar
      on medical imaging I developed based on SGI’s OpenGL Volumizer API. It features user controllable CT transfer functions
      to easily locate bone and skin boundaries, clipping, volumetric lighting, trackball control and asymmetric stereo viewing
      to support immersive environments.</p>

      <h3>LS-DYNA Translator</h3>
      <img src="images/lsdyna.jpg" alt="LS-DYNA"> 
      <p>This project involved writing a data translator from scratch so advanced
      rendering tools such as SGI’s OpenGL Optimizer could be used to visualize the results. The translator was written in
      C++ using the Open Inventor toolkit.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Medical Data Visualizer</h3>
      <img src="images/medvis.jpg" alt="Medical Data Visualizer"> 
      <p>This project was done to complete an upper level course
      in Computer Graphics at the RIT. The application was written using the Visualization
      Toolkit (VTK) and runs under IRIX, LINUX and Windows. It includes features such as volumetric ray tracing, iso-surfacing,
      slicing, segmentation and LOD management and includes a user manual.</p>

      <h3>Video Chalkboard</h3>
      <img src="images/videochalk.jpg" alt="Video Chalk"> 
      <p> Chalkboard is an application that allows the user to use
      the mouse as a pen to write over incoming live video. Each frame of video is captured using SGI’s video libraries and
      is written to the screen as pixels with OpenGL. The pen strokes are accumulated in a linked list then written on top
      of the video pixels as GL_LINES or pixels depending on which command line option is selected. Optionally, the blended
      output may be sent to video out.</p>

      <h3>Kodak DCS digital camera device driver and image viewer</h3>
      <img src="images/dcsviewer.jpg" alt="Blood Cells"> 
      <p> Kodak released the DCS 10000 camera, only drivers existed for
      the Windows operating system. customers to use the camera in collaborative medical environments. The driver was written
      from I developed a driver and imaging application under the IRIX operating system enabling SGI’s scratch using the
      user level SCSI libraries provided with IRIX. Once, the image was acquired from the camera, it was scaled, balanced,
      shifted, interpolated, clipped and color corrected. A programmer’s guide but no example source code was provided by
      Kodak.</p>
