            <h4>OpenGL Shading Framework</h4>
            <span class="left"><img src="images/espyshader.jpg" alt="Fragment Shader" /></span>
            <p>
              I developed an object oriented framework to make working with OpenGL 2.1 easier. The C++ class library initializes OpenGL
              extension entry points, provides file loading, compiling, linking and error checking of vertex and fragment
              programs. Run time methods are provided to enable, disable and pass parameters to programs. The framework’s
              base classes can be sub classed to create more complex shaders as shown in the examples that follow.
            </p>

            <h4>Parallel Ray Tracer</h4>
              <span class="left"><img src="images/smpray.jpg" alt="Parallel Ray Tracer"></span>
            <p>I ported a real-time SMP ray tracing program from IRIX/GL/SPROC to Linux/OpenGL/POSIX threads to demonstrate
              how scalable computing can be synchronized with double buffered OpenGL rendering. Arrays of semaphores were
              used to provide a barrier to synchronize worker threads with OpenGL buffer swaps.

            <h3>GPU-based Scalable Volumetric Shading</h3>

                <span class="right"><img src="images/skullshaded.jpg" alt="Volumetric Shader"></span>
             <p>Phong Shading</p>
            <p>For SGI’s Prism system, I implemented a GPU fragment program, written in SIMD assembler, that performs high quality
              lighting on volumetric data. The OpenGL Volumizer API provided a multiple GPU scalable framework based on 2D
              screen decomposition. As each slice of the volume is rendered, callbacks are used to generate texture coordinates
              which are passed to the fragment shader. Using the texture coordinates, the shader computes the gradients on
              the fly using a forward difference method. Once the gradients are obtained, a full Phong lighting model is
              computed for each fragment. The user is able to control the light source and object position in real time.</p>

                <span class="left"><img src="images/kozmri.jpg" alt="Bob's MRI"></span>
              
            <p> This sample application was written to complement an introductory seminar on medical imaging I developed based
              on SGI’s OpenGL Volumizer API. It features user controllable CT transfer functions to easily locate bone and
              skin boundaries, clipping, volumetric lighting, trackball control and asymmetric stereo viewing to support
              immersive environments.</p>

            <h3>Medical Data Visualizer</h3>
            <span class="left"><img src="images/medvis.jpg" alt="Medical Data Visualizer"></span>
            <p>This project was done to complete an upper level course in Computer Graphics at the RIT. The application was
              written using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and runs under IRIX, LINUX and Windows. It includes features
              such as volumetric ray tracing, iso-surfacing, slicing, segmentation and LOD management and includes a user
              manual.</p>

            <h3>Video Chalkboard</h3>
            <span class="left"><img src="images/videochalk.jpg" alt="Video Chalk"></span>
            <p> Chalkboard is an application that allows the user to use the mouse as a pen to write over incoming live video.
              Each frame of video is captured using SGI’s video libraries and is written to the screen as pixels with OpenGL.
              The pen strokes are accumulated in a linked list then written on top of the video pixels as GL_LINES or pixels
              depending on which command line option is selected. Optionally, the blended output may be sent to video out.</p>

            <h3>Kodak DCS digital camera device driver and image viewer</h3>
            <span class="left"><img src="images/dcsviewer.jpg" alt="Blood Cells"></span>
            <p> Kodak released the DCS 10000 camera, only drivers existed for the Windows operating system. customers to use
              the camera in collaborative medical environments. The driver was written from I developed a driver and imaging
              application under the IRIX operating system enabling SGI’s scratch using the user level SCSI libraries provided
              with IRIX. Once, the image was acquired from the camera, it was scaled, balanced, shifted, interpolated, clipped
              and color corrected. A programmer’s guide but no example source code was provided by Kodak.
