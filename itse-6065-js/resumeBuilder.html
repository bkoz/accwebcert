Description: 

This project will demonstrate your ability to collect data from an HTML form, process that data using Javascript, 
and print out a formatted report back to the user. Write a Javascript program that displays an HTML form for your 
user to fill out. Collect your user's first name, last name, street address, city, zip and country. 
Then collect the user's occupation and education level. Provide a textarea box for the user to write a paragraph 
about his/her hobbies and interests.

Your script will gather the data from this form when the user clicks a submit button. It will then create and 
display an HTML page to the user. This HTML page will summarize all of the information the user has entered in 
an attractive, resume style Web page.

There are many ways to write this program. The easiest way is to use window.open() to open a new window to 
output the resume. But, you have also learned more advanced techniques, such as using .innerHTML to change 
the content of paragraphs and divs in the current page. Use the method you are comfortable with at this time.

I don't mind if students work in pairs on this assignment. You can communicate using the course forum or the 
student chat room, or meet in person if you like. But, if you do work with another student, please keep in mind 
that I will expect your Javascript application to reflect that two students worked on the project. So, be 
prepared to hand in a very well designed, attractive app with bells and whistles!

You will be graded on your style, as well as your coding and functionality, so be sure to make your HTML form 
and resulting output neat and attractive. Add a header image, other images, and fonts and color to your output. 
Create something you will be proud to add your your professional portfolio!

The highest possible score for this assignment is 70 points.
