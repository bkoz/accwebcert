Description: 
Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her age. Your program will respond to the user, 
using an alert dialog, and your response will depend on the user's age.

If the user is under 18, you will respond with, "Wow, you are young".
If the user is between the ages of 18 and 23, your response will be, "You are getting on in years".
And, if the user is over 23 years old, you will respond with, "Wow, you are really old".
